# Office_Party
Video Game made for the Technology Student Association Competition

## Description
This is a game that Matthew Johnson, Parth Mehta, and Isaiah Williams made for Technology Student Association (TSA) competition. The object of the game is to solve puzzles with a partner to escape the Office Party.

## Installation
To install the game, simply download the .jar file from the repository. Then to play the game, you need to open the file to run it.

You may encounter some problems running the file on Mac, mainly with a warning saying that the game is from an unidentified developer. This warning can be circumvented by two-finger clicking on the file and clicking the "open" option in the drop down. Then a new warning will pop up with an option asking you if you still want to open it. Then, you will be prompted to enter your macs username and password which is required to whitelist the game and override your security preferences. 

To our knowledge, you will not encounter a similar problem on windows. However, if you do, there are numerous forums and help for running .jar files from unidentified developers. 

Please note, despite the warnings, we assure you that this game does not contain any malicious or harmful code and that this is simply and project for a competition.
